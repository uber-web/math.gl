# math.gl

Please refer to the extensive [online documentation](https://visgl.github.io/math.gl).

For practical reasons, development of math.gl is continuing in a new [repository](https://github.com/visgl/math.gl).

To avoid forking of the code base, this repository is closed to contributions for now.

Please open any issues, discussions or pull requests in the new repository.
