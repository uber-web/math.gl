# `@math.gl/geospatial` Overview

The `@math.gl/geospatial` librarys provides support for geospatial math.

It provides classes and utilities to facilitate working with the major geospatial coordinate systems and projections used with computer maps, primarily:

- [WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) (World Geodetic System) coordinates.
- [Web Mercator Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection)


## Ellipsoid and WGS84

| Class                   | Dewscription |
| ---                     | --- |
| `Ellipsoid`             | Implements ellipsoid |
| `Ellipsoid.WSG84`       | An `Ellipsoid` instance initialized with Earth radii per WGS84. |

## Usage Examples

A major use of this library is to convert between "cartesian" (`x`, `y`, `z`) and "cartographic" (`longitude`, `latitude`, `height`) representations of WSG84 coordinates. The `Ellipsoid` class implements these calculations.

## Usage

Determine the Cartesian representation of a Cartographic position on a WGS84 ellipsoid.
```js
import {toRadians} from 'math.gl';
import {Ellipsoid} from '@math.gl/geospatial';
const cartographicPosition = [toRadians(21), toRadians(78), 5000];
const cartesianPosition = Ellipsoid.WGS84.cartographicToCartesian(cartographicPosition);
```

Determine the Cartographic representation of a Cartesian position on a WGS84 ellipsoid.
```js
import {Ellipsoid} from '@math.gl/geospatial';
const cartesianPosition = [17832.12, 83234.52, 952313.73];
const cartographicPosition = Ellipsoid.WGS84.cartesianToCartographic(cartesianPosition);
```

Get the transform from local east-north-up at cartographic (0.0, 0.0) to Earth's fixed frame.
```js
import {Ellipsoid} from '@math.gl/geospatial';
const transformMatrix = Ellipsoid.WGS84.eastNorthUpToFixedFrame([0, 0, 0]);
```

## Framework Independence

Like all non-core math.gl modules, this module can be used independently of core math.gl classes.

- Any input or result vectors can be supplied as JavaScript `Array` instances of length 3, or objects with `x`, `y`, `z` elements.


## History

This library was initially developed as a fork of selected classes from Cesium math library, as part of a collaboration between vis.gl and Cesium teams to provide framework-independent, portable support for the 3D tiles specification.
