# Accuracy of Offset Projection

`getDistanceScales` offers a cheap way to project lng/lat or meter offset to pixels. It is useful when using the GPU to project a cluster of coordinates near an origin point, without suffering the precision loss of WebGL.

This article discusses the usage and accuracy of the distance scales.

# Meter offset to pixels

Regular meter offset to pixels projection:
```
uniform vec3 pixelsPerMeter;
vec3 meters_offset_to_pixels_offset(vec3 meters) {
    return meters * pixelsPerMeter;
}
```

When `getDistanceScales` is called with flag `highPrecision: true`, it generates additional multipliers to compensate for precision loss over latitude change. More precise meter offset to pixels projection:
```
uniform vec3 pixelsPerMeter;
uniform vec3 pixelsPerMeter2;
vec3 meters_offset_to_pixels_offset_adjusted(vec3 meters) {
    return meters * (pixelsPerMeter + pixelsPerMeter2 * meters.y);
}
```

Accuracy at San Francisco (37N, z = 12):

| --- | ---- | ---- |
| 100 meters | off by -0.000 pixels, 0.001% | off by 0.000 pixels, 0.001% |
| 1000 meters | off by -0.008 pixels, 0.012% | off by 0.000 pixels, 0.001% |

Accuracy at high latitude (75N, z = 12):

# LngLat offset to pixels

Regular lng_lat offset to pixels projection:
```
uniform vec3 pixelsPerDegree;
vec3 lnglat_offset_to_pixels_offset(vec3 lngLatZ) {
    return lngLatZ * pixelsPerDegree;
}
```

When `getDistanceScales` is called with flag `highPrecision: true`, it generates additional multipliers to compensate for precision loss over latitude change. More precise meter offset to pixels projection:
```
uniform vec3 pixelsPerDegree;
uniform vec3 pixelsPerDegree2;
vec3 lnglat_offset_to_pixels_offset_adjusted(vec3 lngLatZ) {
    return lngLatZ * (pixelsPerDegree + pixelsPerDegree2 * lngLatZ.y);
}
```
