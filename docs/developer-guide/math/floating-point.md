### About Comparisons

Due to small rounding errors, exact equality is often not a reliable way to compare floating point numbers. Therefore the default `equals` operation checks that two numbers are within a small delta.

There is also an `exactEquals` method that compares the floating point values directly.

```js
return Math.abs(a - b) <= config.EPSILON * Math.max(1.0, Math.abs(a), Math.abs(b));
```
