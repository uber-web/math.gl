# Roadmap

A number of workstreams are in progress on math.gl

* Add benchmarks and optimize object creation etc.
* Reduce dist size: Move to a-la-carte imports (v2)
* Reduce dist size: Start using limited transpilation for evergreen browsers (v2)
* Experiment with geometry primitives, to see if frustum culling and ray casting can be usefully expressed as pure math classec.
