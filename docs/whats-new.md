# What's New

## v1.1

Date: TBD

## Matrix4 improvements

* **`Matrix4.orthographic`** - To simplify switching between perspective and orthographic views, math.gl now offers an additional method for creating orthographic projection matrix, that takes the same parameters as `Matrix4.perspective()`, with the addition of one additional parameter, `focalDistance`. See `Matrix4.orthographic({fovY, aspect, focalDistance, near, far})`

## v1.0

Initial release.
