# Vector4

`Vector4` is designed to hold three dimensional coordinates in projective space. Using the projective representation allows JavaScript applications to perform the same calculations that the GPU does.

A main feature of vectors is that they can be transformed by matrices and quaternions. And `Vector4`s are particular general when transformed with 4x4 matrices (`Matrix4` or just arrays of 16 numbers), as those can include translations, projections and other transformations that cannot be expressed by e.g. 3x3 matrices or quaternions alone.

Note that the fourth element `w` is not a coordinate but a scaling factor. The fourth component (`w`) is usually set to either

- `0` to represent a vector
- `1` to represent a point

`Vector4` methods will keep the vector scaled so that `w` (if non-zero) is `1`.

The math behind `Vector4` comes from projective geometry, which significantly generalizes calculations and removes a number of special cases compared to affine geometry. It is not necessary to understand the details to use `Vector4`, but see the developer guide for some additional xbackground.

## Usage

```js
import {Vector4} from '@math.gl/core';
const vector = new Vector4(1, 1, 1, 0);
const point = new Vector4(0, 0, 0, 1);
```

## Inheritance

`Vector4` extends [`Vector`](./docs/api-reference/vector) extends [`MathArray`](./docs/api-reference/math-array) extends [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

## Members

### x, y, z, w

Gets or sets element 0, 1, 2 or 3 respectively

## Methods

Many of the most commonly used `Vector2` methods are inherited from [`MathArray`](./docs/api-reference/math-array.md):

- `Vector4.clone()`
- `Vector4.copy(array)`
- `Vector4.set(...args)`
- `Vector4.fromArray(array, offset = 0)`
- `Vector4.toString()`
- `Vector4.toArray(array = [], offset = 0)`
- `Vector4.equals(array)`
- `Vector4.exactEquals(array)`
- `Vector4.validate(array = this)`
- `Vector4.check(array = this)`
- `Vector4.normalize()`

Note that `Vector2` is a subclass of the built in JavaScript `Array` and can thus e.g. be supplied as a parameter to any function expecting an `Array`.

### constructor(x?: number, y?: number, z?: number, w?: number)

`new Vector4(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, w = 0)`

Creates a new, empty `Vector4`

### set(x?: number, y?: number, z?: number, w?: number): thos

Updates a `Vector4`

### distance(vector: number[4]): number

Returns the distance to the specifed Vector.

### distanceSquared(vector: number[4]): number

Returns the squared distance to the specifed Vector. Fast to calculate than distance and often sufficient for e.g. sorting etc.

### dot(vector: number[4]): number

Calculates the dot product with the supplied `vector`.

### add(vector: number[4]): Vector4

`add(...vectors)`

### subtract(vector: number[4]): Vector4

`subtract(...vectors)`

### multiply(vector: number[4]): Vector4

`multiply(...vectors)`

### divide(vector: number[4]): Vector4

`divide(...vectors)`

### scale(vector: number[4]): Vector4

`scale(scale)`

### negate(): this

Negates each element in the vector.

### inverse(): this

Inverses (`x = 1/x`) each element in the vector.

### normalize(): this

Normalizes the vector. Same direction but `len()` will now return `1`.

### lerp(vector: number[4], coefficient: number): this

Linearly interpolates between the vectors current value and the supplied `vector`.

### transform(matrix4: number[16]): Vector4

Equivalent to `transformByMatrix4`.

### transformByMatrix4(matrix4: number[16]): Vector4

Transforms a vector by the provided 4x4 matrix.

Note: Scales the resulting vector to ensure that `w`, if non-zero, is set to `1`.

### transformByMatrix3(matrix3: number[9]): Vector4

Transforms the vector's `x`, `y` and `z` values by the provided 3x3 matrix.

### transformByMatrix2(matrix2: number[4]): Vector4

Transform the vector's `x` and `y` values by the provided 2x2 matrix.

### transformByQuaternion(quaternion: number[4]): Vector4

Transform the vector by the provided `quaternion`.
