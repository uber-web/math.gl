Note that in spite of its name, math.gl has no actual WebGL dependencies (e.g. it does not use WebGL or GPU to perform calculations). However, the math.gl API is optimized for use in WebGL applications and GPU compute use cases. Modules math.gl is a toolbox that offers a suite of composable modules. 3D math is supported by Module Category Description @math.gl/core Core Basic 3D math classes (vectors, matrices etc) and utilities ( equals ,  toRadians  etc) @math.gl/culling 3D Bounding volumes and intersection testing. Geospatial calculations  are supported by Module Category Description @math.gl/geospatial Geospatial Ellipsoidal Earth surface model, e.g for transformations between WGS84 cartesian and cartographic coordinates. @math.gl/geoid Geospatial Irregular Earth surface model (defined by Earth Gravity Model files). @math.gl/polygon Geospatial Polygon math, including geospatial cutting etc. @math.gl/proj4 Geospatial Conversion between coordinate reference systems. @math.gl/sun Geospatial Calculate solar position and direction based on position and time. @math.gl/web-mercator Geospatial Spherical Earth surface model. Supports 3D Web Mercator projections. In addition, math.gl provides a few legacy modules. These are not recommended for new code, but are still provided to avoid breaking older applications. Legacy Module Description math.gl Re-exports the API from  @math.gl/core . The  math.gl  module is now considered deprecated. It is still available as an \"alias\" for  @math.gl/core  but should not be used in new applications. viewport-mercator-project Re-exports the Web Mercator projection utilities in  @math.gl/web-mercator . This code was orignally developed indendently in the  https://github.com/uber-common/viewport-mercator-project  repository, however the module was consolidated with math.gl in Oct 2019. Core Library Features Classes for gl-matrix  - math.gl classes are built on top of  gl-matrix .  gl-matrix  has a reputation for being the most performant and battle-tested JavaScript math library around. Array-Based  - math.gl classes (like  Vector3 ,  Matrix4 ) are subclasses of the built-in JavaScript  Array  which enables applications to use them interchangeably with plain (or typed) arrays. Debug Friendly  - math.gl offers  optional  error checking after every math operation which makes quick work of locating coding errors and bad input data. Printing support for objects ( toString ) also simplifies debugging. Documentation  - If you are new to 3D programming it can be hard to know where to start. math.gl comes with articles to show you the big picture and get you up-to-speed on the mathematical concepts and the corresponding classes. Size Conscious  - math.gl is published as multiple modules to let applications cherry-pick required functionality, and is optimizes dependencies for tree-shaking to make sure you only pay for (bundle) what you use. Supported Browsers and Node Versions math.gl is fully supported on: Evergreen browsers: Recent versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge etc. Node.js: Active and Maintenance  LTS releases IE11: Supported (with certain performance caveats) using math.gl's fully transpiled  es5  distribution and  @babel/polyfills . Note that Internet Explorer < 10 will not work. If your application needs to support older browsers, an option could be to use  gl-matrix  directly. Key Design Ideas ES6 allows JavaScript classes to be derived from the built-in arrays gl-matrix provides high-performance math that works directly on arrays. Geospatial frameworks like deck.gl and mapbox-gl expect vectors to be supplied in the form of JavaScript arrays. History The core classes were originally developed as part of luma.gl v4 to provide a basic 3D math library for the luma.gl and deck.gl frameworks. math.gl was then broken out into its own module to allow it to mature in terms of functionality and stability. Through a collaboration with the Cesium team, parts of the Cesium math library are ported and published as independently usable math.gl modules (geospatial and culling). Attributions math.gl was inspired by and built upon some of the most proven open source JavaScript math libraries: gl-matrix  - math.gl classes use gl-matrix under the hood THREE.js math library - math.gl classes are API-compatible with a subset of the THREE.js classes and pass THREE.js test suites. Cesium math library (Apache2) - The geospatial and culling modules were ported from Cesium code base. License MIT license. The libraries that the core  math.gl  module are built on (e.g. gl-matrix) are also all open source and MIT licensed. The  @math.gl/geospatial  and  @math.gl/culling  models include Cesium-derived code which is Apache2 licensed.","headings":[{"value":"Introduction","depth":1},{"value":"Modules","depth":2},{"value":"Core Library Features","depth":2},{"value":"Supported Browsers and Node Versions","depth":2},{"value":"Key Design Ideas","depth":2},{"value":"History","depth":2},{"value":"Attributions","depth":2},{"value":"License","depth":2}],"slug":"docs","title":"Introduction"},{"excerpt":"Roadmap 3D Primitives Add a submodule with the geometry primitives from luma.gl.

Notes: Order is  [lng, lat]  (it can help to think of them as  [x, y]  to remember the order). lng goes from -180 to 180. lat goes from -85.051129 to 85.051129. The reason for the latitude cutoff is that the cylindrical mercator projection projects the earth sphere onto an infinitely tall strip, with the poles being projected at infinity. The reason that the cutoff is at ~85 degrees is that cutting off at this value makes the remaining projected area into a square (which at zoom 0 is projected onto 512x512 \"pixels\"). For details see e.g.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator . World Coordinates World coordinates specifies a location on the linear Web Mercator plane. Each unit is a \"pixel\" on the Web Mercator tile. It is unique for each lngLat location at a specific zoom level.  [x, y, z]  corresponds to  [longitude, latitude, elevation]  in the LngLat system. Pixel Coordinates Pixel coordinates specifies a point on screen in the format of  [x, y, z]  where x and y are in pixels on screen and  z  is pixel depth, normally between  -1  and  1 . By default, the pixel coordinate system of the viewport is defined with the origin in the top left, where the positive x-axis goes right, and the positive y-axis goes down. That is, the top left corner is  [0, 0]  and the bottom right corner is  [width - 1, height - 1] . The  project / unproject  functions have a flag that can reverse this convention. Additional Notes Per cartographic tradition, all angles including  latitude ,  longitude ,\n pitch  and  bearing  are specified in degrees, not radians. It is possible to query the PerspectiveMercatorViewport for a meters per pixel scale.\nNote that that distance scales are latitude dependent under\nweb mercator projection  see ,\nso scaling will depend on the viewport center and any linear scale factor\nshould only be expected to be locally correct.","headings":[{"value":"Web Mercator Coordinates","depth":1},{"value":"LngLat Coordinates","depth":3},{"value":"World Coordinates","depth":3},{"value":"Pixel Coordinates","depth":3},{"value":"Additional Notes","depth":3}],"slug":"modules/web-mercator/docs/developer-guide/about-coordinates","title":"Web Mercator Coordinates"},{"excerpt":"Web Mercator Utility Functions lngLatToWorld(lngLat) Project a coordinate on sphere onto the 512x512 Web Mercator plane.

Web Mercator Projection Classes Class Description Proj4Projection A projection class Usage Reproject WGS84 coordinates to another CRS Geospatial Coordinate Systems There are an infinite number of possible coordinate systems; therefore strict syntax is required to describe the parameters of any given CRS. Two main systems are supported in this module: Proj4 strings and WKT strings. Within WKT there exists both OGC WKT and ESRI WKT syntax; both are generally supported though some more-obscure projection keywords may not be used. Note that Proj4 strings  can be slightly more accurate  in some circumstances than WKT strings. There are thousands of named \"EPSG\" projections. This module only includes aliases for those in the section below by default. To use a different EPSG projection, you can use  https://epsg.io . For example,  https://epsg.io/4326  defines standard longitude-latitude coordinates and lists multiple projection strings. Choose one of the  OGC WKT ,  ESRI WKT , or  PROJ.4  strings listed. The epsg.io website also has a public API, e.g., for WGS 84:  https://epsg.io/?q=4326&format=json If you already know the EPSG identifier, you can make the API request even simpler by adding the desired extension to your url: Aliases Note that Proj4Projection allows aliases to be defined and comes with the following pre-installed aliases.

Classes Class Description Ellipsoid Implements ellipsoid Ellipsoid.WSG84 An  Ellipsoid  instance initialized with Earth radii per WGS84. Usage Examples A major use of this library is to convert between \"cartesian\" ( x ,  y ,  z ) and \"cartographic\" ( longitude ,  latitude ,  height ) representations of WSG84 coordinates. The  Ellipsoid  class implements these calculations. Usage Determine the Cartesian representation of a Cartographic position on a WGS84 ellipsoid. Determine the Cartographic representation of a Cartesian position on a WGS84 ellipsoid. Get the transform from local east-north-up at cartographic (0.0, 0.0) to Earth's fixed frame.

Documentation Most JavaScript 3D math libraries come with a reference documentation only. It can be a Size Conscious A math library can quickly get big as a various , gl-matrix is a good example, there are a number of modules on npm that contain subsets of gl-matrix to work around its size. Focus on functions that are likely to be most important in WebGL applications. Supported Browsers Some background: math.gl classes are subclasses of the built-in JavaScript  Array .  Array  subclassing is an ES6/JS2015 feature. This feature (even after being transpiled to ES5) does not work with older browsers. For details of the technical complication, see ( babel-plugin-transform-builtin-extend ). Overview math.gl is a JavaScript math library primarily intended to support WebGL applications. It is a generic library but was developed as a companion for  luma.gl  and  deck.gl . math.gl contains a set of classes (Matrix4 etc) to complement the procedural interface of gl-matrix. It also imports a limited subset of the standard  gl-matrix  functions (to keep bundle size down), these can be used in parallel with the classes. Who is this for? JavaScript WebGL programmers who: Need a great JavaScript math library for basic computional geometry purposes. like the functionality offered by the gl-matrix library need tree-shaking support want to use object orientated math programming style (ability to chain operations). want optional extra error checking do not need to support old (pre-IE10) browsers. Features Array-based All math objects can be used directly with any Javascript function that expects array arguments. No need to call  toArray  or similar. Error checking  to assist in debugging. Can be disabled when performance is critical. WebGL-friendly Matrices: while all accessors,  toString()  etc are row-major. Matrices are organized internally in the layout expected by WebGL (an array of contiguous floats in column-major order), toArray  and  fromArray  functions take optional offsets allowing copying directly to and from vertex attribute arrays. GLSL math functions (radians, sin etc) made available in JavaScript and work both on scalars and vectors / math objects. Design Notes Math objects are  Arrays  - All math objects are subclasses of the built-in JavaScript  Array  class, which means that class instances can be used wherever an array is expected. I.e. these classes are not wrappers of  Array s, they  are   Array s, just with additional methods. Focuses on needs of WebGL based applications and basic computational geometry, which includes 4x4 matrices, 2, 3 and 4 dimensional vectors and quaternions. May grow to include other classes, but is not intended to become a general math library. History Started out as a set of object oriented wrappers for the procedural  gl-matrix  library. Roadmap Additional classes and functions. This library might grow beyond just providing  gl-matrix  wrappers if additional classes are deemed valuable for the target user group. API differences with gl-matrix The class API is intentionally designed to remain intuitively similar to the wrapped  gl-matrix  procedures, usually just removing the first one or two parameters from each function (the out argument and the first input arguments, both are implictly set to this), and exposes the remaining arguments in the same order as the gl-matrix api. Only in a few cases where  gl-matrix  methods take a long list arguments (e.g.  mat4.perspective ,  mat4.ortho  etc) or return multiple values (e.g.  quat.getAxisRotation ) do methods provide a modified API that is more natural for modern ES6 applications to use, e.g. using named parameters, or collecting all results in one returned object. Also, for transforming vectors with matrices, the  transform*  methods are offered in the matrix classes, instead of on the vector classes. They also (optionally) auto allocate the result vectors. Caveats A technical caveat is that JavaScript  Array  subclassing, which is fundamental to the design of this library, is only supported on \"evergreen\" browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge etc, i.e. no Internet Explorer < 10 ( details ). If this is not acceptable, math.gl is not the right choice for you. As a fallback, you can always use  gl-matrix  directly.","headings":[{"value":"Features (WIP)","depth":1},{"value":"Array-based","depth":2},{"value":"Supported Browsers","depth":2},{"value":"Overview","depth":2},{"value":"Who is this for?","depth":2},{"value":"Features","depth":2},{"value":"Design Notes","depth":1},{"value":"History","depth":1},{"value":"Roadmap","depth":1},{"value":"API differences with gl-matrix","depth":2},{"value":"Caveats","depth":2}],"slug":"modules/core/docs/wip/features","title":"Features (WIP)"},{"excerpt":"Debugging This article is a work in progress.

The  gl-matrix docs  are a good start. Additionally, the gl-matrix source code is partially updated with JSDoc. Using with THREE.js math.gl makes efforts to be compatible with the THREE.js math API. Method Interoperability In particular, the basic math.gl math classes have implementations of most of the methods that THREE.js defines. math.gl THREE.js Notable differences Vector2 THREE.Vector2 length()  =>  len() Vector3 THREE.Vector3 ditto Vector4 THREE.Vector4 ditto Matrix3 THREE.Matrix3 Math.gl stores in column-major order by default Matrix4 THREE.Matrix4 ditto Can a THREE.Math class be created/initialized from a math.gl class? Probably yes, as we expose x, y, z accessors Can a math.gl class be created/initialized from a THREE.Math class? Probably not yet, as we don't look for x, y, z. Notable Incompatibilities Colum-Major vs. Row-Major Matrices By default, math.gl stores matrices in column-major order internally (while exposing a row-major friendly interface), whereas THREE.js stores matrices in row-major order. Array.length() Since math.gl's classes are subclasses of JavaScripts built-in  Array  class, the  length  property has the special meaning defined by  Array , so it is not possible to implement the  Vector.length()  method defined by THREE.js. Instead a  Vector.len()  method is offered on math.gl  Vector  classes. Cross-Library Convenience Methods A complication with THREE.js is that the framework is not strict about separating the library into independent layers. Thus the THREE math classes have convenience methods that accept other THREE.js objects such  Geometries  and  BufferAttributes . These methods are not implemented in math.gl. Remarks An indicator of the level of THREE.js compatibility is the fact that math.gl includes a copy of the math test suites from THREE.js, parts of which pass cleanly when run the math.gl classes listed above (admittedly with a few disabled cases). While it would of course be nice to be able to state \"100% compatiblity\" with the THREE.js math API, there are hard technical constraints. For instance, since math.gl's classes are subclasses of JavaScripts built-in  Array  class, the  length  property has the special meaning defined by  Array , so it is not possible to implement the  Vector.length()  method defined by THREE.js. Note that THREE.js compatibility methods will not always be implemented in the most performant way.

Objects are typically vectors but can also be more complex object such as spheres, planes, boxes etc, and transformations are typically represented by matrices and quaternions. Representing Transformations Transformations can be represented in many different notations but for computational purposes it is efficient to express them as matrices, or in some cases as quaternions. The most general transform is a 4x4 matrix. See the article on  homogeneous coordinates  for some advantages in using 4x4 matrices to represent transformations. Applying transformations Most math.gl classes offer a  transform  method that accepts matrices and quaternions. The various vector classes also offer methods to transform with smaller matrices Quaternion transformations are also supported on some objects Note that  <object>.transform()  operations modify the object being transformed (and also return the modified object to enable \"chaining\" of calls). Alternatively, transformations can also be performed via the matrix and quaternion classes. In this case, the transformation is stored in the result parameters (a new array is allocated if it  result  is not supplied.) Types of Transformations The basic transformations are rotations, scalings, and translations. Composing Transformations One of the most powerful aspects of using matrices to manage transformations is that matrices can be multiplied together using linear algebra. This allows us to build up a complex transformation by multiplying together component parts. Matrix4  provides a number of transformation methods ('scale', 'rotate', 'translate', ...) that allow us to build transformation matrices. These can be applied to an identity matrix (e.g. a newly created  Matrix4 ) or to a matrix that already contains other transformations. Order Matters When composing (i.e. multiplying) matrices it is critical to consider the order in which they are being applied, as changing the order of component will in most cases change the resulting composite transformation. It is not hard to verify that this is consistent with geometric intuition by composing a few operations on paper. Because of this the  Matrix4  class provides two matrix multiplication methods:  multiplyLeft  and  multiplyRight  that force you to make explicit what you intend when multiplying two matrices. All  Matrix4  transformation methods ('scale', 'rotate', 'translate', ...) conceptually correspond to multiplying in a new transformation matrix from the right (although these methods internally are more efficient in that they don't create any temporary objects and they only do the minimal amount of changes to the matrix required for that specific transformation). In the end, the point or vector to be transformed will be multiplied in from the right, which means that a typical composed transformation needs to be read in reverse order. I.e. in the example below, the vector will first be rotated, then transformed by the  partialTransform , then scaled. About Rotations For more in-depth background about rotations, see the separate article on  rotations . If you have a vector with 3 elements you can rotate it around an axis and a point like so: Decomposing Transformations The ability to compose transformations naturally leads to the possibility of  decomposing  a composite transformations into constituent parts. This is possible with certain caveats.

Since math.gl uses gl-matrix functions under the hood, math.gl's performance is usually very close to gl-matrix, but the additional conveniences in math.gl do come with a certain overhead. Understanding this overhead can help you write more performant code and work around performance issues. In cases where javascript math calculations are performance critical, you can always use gl-matrix operations directly. See (./docs/get-started/using-with-gl-matrix.md). Essentially, since all math.gl classes inherit from  Array s they work directly as arguments to gl-matrix functions, no copying necessary. Disabling Debug Checks If debug mode has been turned on, math.gl checks that objects after every operation. Enabling the checks has a modest impact on performance. Verifying that error checks are not turned on. Minimizing Object Creation The biggest performance issue in math.gl (and essentially all other JavaScript math libraries) is object creation cost. Creating new  Vector3  and  Matrix4  instances every time a calculation is made incurs significant overhead. There are two standard techniques to avoid object creation costs. Resuing Objects Therefore, reusing objects where possible is an important technique to optimize performance. A typical technique is to allocate a global object in the file. Replace with Note that while creating objects can be slow, copying data into a temo object (e.g.  vector4.copy([1, 1, 1, 1])  or  vector4.copy([1, 1, 1, 1]) ) is very fast. Supplying  result  Objects A number of methods, such as  Matrix4.transformVector() , allocate new objects as return values. These methods typically accept an optional  result  argument which can be populated and returned. By providing a  result  value, you revent the allocation of a new object and instead reuse an object you have already allocated. vs. Browser, OS version etc The JavaScript engine powering Chrome and Node is still improving. The performance difference between e.g. Node 8 and Node 11 is rather staggering. Benchmarking The math.gl repository comes with a benchmark suite that you can run to see what operations are fast and which take more time in your environment. You can run the benchmarks both in Node.js and in the browser JavaScript Engine Optimizations This section should be considered advanced, and is not required reading for the normal math.gl user. However if you are writing your own math code it can be useful to have an understanding. To get good performance it is important to structure code so that it can be compiled and optimized by the JavaScript engine in use. math.gl focuses on optimizing for the V8 engine, since it is used both by Chrome and Node.js, however the optimizations are general and should also be relevant to other optimizing JavaScript engines. In particular, math.gl makes efforts to ensure that the engine knows that fields in math classes contain numbers, which allows for important optimizations that can result in a  ~ 5x performance difference for simple operations.

There are many possible ways to represent points in space using coordinates, e.g. rectangular, elliptical, polar/spherical, etc. Which coordinate system is the best depends entirely on the problem at hand. When working with specific geometrical problems, it is often the case that the required mathematical operations become more simple in a certain coordinate system which means that it is worth being familiar both with a few different coordinate system and also how to convert between them. math.gl provides support for a couple of 3D coordinate systems: Rectilinear ( Vector3 ) - Typically used to represent standard Cartesian space Spherical ( SpericalCoordinates ) - Two angles representing point on sphere and a distance from center Projective/Homogeneous ( Vector4 ) - These are coordinates in \"projective\" 3-space.

The math.gl  Vector4  class is not normally used to represent four dimensonal points. Instead it is intended to be used to calculate with 3 dimensonal  homogeneous coordinates , as defined by projective geometry. Mathematically, in projective geometry, each  Vector4  is interpreted as a point on a 3D line through the origin. And it is this line that is the primary object, in the sense that the point is only considered to be one of infinintely many \"representatives\" of that a line through the origin. Dividing  xyz  with the same number will generate another point, or 'representative' of the same line The main reason homogeneous coordinates and projective geometry are used in 3D graphics programming is that they allow perspective projection and translations to be represented as linear transformations using 4x4 matrices. The W Coordinate Mathematically, homogeneous coordinates add one extra dimension to represent a number. In the 3 dimensional computer graphics case, it is customary to refer to the extra (4th) components as  w . Mathematically, the  w  coordinate indicates which representative along the projective line. There is a straightforward graphical interpretation of the  w  coordinate: During projection of a set of homogeneous vectors onto a plane at distance 1 from the origin, all the vectors are normalized so that their  w  coordinates are  1  by dividing  xyz  with  w . which leads to the following graphical interpretation: w Graphical Interpretation >  1 your object will look smaller <  1 your object will look bigger =  0 will cause a crash or undefined behavior <  0 will flip your object (upside-down, back-to-front, ...) Both math.gl and typical GPUs do not support calculations on homogeneous coordinates with a  w  component of zero. (However, zero  w coordinates play a very important role in general projective geometry, see \"Background\" below). Practical Usage Projective Transformation A general projective transformation matrix has the following format Translation of 3D coordinates Linear transformations on a vector space can not move the origin, they can only scale and rotate. Translations leave the  w  coordinate unchanged. As can be seen in the general format of the projection matrix, setting  w  to 0 prevents a vector from picking up the translations when multiplied with a 4x4 matrix. (easy to see as the translations are stored in the final column of the transposed matrix) Perspective Transformation Note that in general, a perspective transformation (i.e. multipliying) do change the  w  coordinate of the  Vector4 , so vectors must be \"scaled\" after transformation when used in JavaScript. GPU Note: the GPU automatically divides  vec4   xyz  components with  w  when they are returned from the vertex shader (when homogeneous coordinates are returned from the vertex shader (typically by assigning a  vec4  to  gl_Position ). This can be an important detail to be aware of when comparing JavaScript and GLSL code, and also when working in screen space (post-projection) in the vertex shader, in which case you typically do need to perform the  w  scaling yourself. Background Information Some fun facts to provide additional context around homogeneous coordinates. Projective geometry was coordinatized (in the form or homogeneous coordinates) in the early 1800s by Plücker and Möbius, almost 200 years after the coordinatization of \"affine\" geometry by Descartes. There is a special  notation  for homogeneous coordinate vectors that emphasizes the relative aspect of the values: However, in mathematics, one of the most important aspects of projective geometry is that it can be used to avoid handling of  special cases  (this aspect is not used in math.gl). Essentially, in contrast to line equations in affine geometry, projective geometry allows parallel lines to be represented by adding a set of additional points in the form of a \"plane at infinity\" (which is represented by  w = 0 ). This is powerful as it makes it possible to e.g. make statements about geometry (such as two lines always meet in one point) without having to make tedious exceptions for parallel lines.","headings":[{"value":"Homogeneous Coordinates","depth":1},{"value":"The W Coordinate","depth":3},{"value":"Practical Usage","depth":2},{"value":"Projective Transformation","depth":3},{"value":"Translation of 3D coordinates","depth":3},{"value":"Perspective Transformation","depth":3},{"value":"Background Information","depth":2}],"slug":"modules/core/docs/concepts/homogeneous-coordinates","title":"Homogeneous Coordinates"},{"excerpt":"3D Rotations This article is a work in progress. math.gl provides a \"standard 3D library complement\" of mathematical classes for handling rotations in 2D and 3D, such as classes for manipulating  Euler  angles and  Quaternion s. As in any 3D math library, the key goals are enabling applications to easily and intuitively specify (parametrize) rotations, combine them with other rotations and other transformations, and ultimately transform points with the rotations or resulting transformations. While math.gl is intended to help programmers' implement the typical 3D application's rotation functionality with a minimum amount of knowledge, and does not even attempt to support rotations in more than 3 dimensions, it should be pointed out that the mathematical treatment of rotations can be very complicated. For some context on this see the background section at the end of this article. Properties of 3D Rotations In contrast to 2D rotations, 3D rotations are not order-independent, meaning that applying the same two rotations in different order will often yield different results. However, by  Euler's Rotation Theorem , two 3D rotations around the origin can always be expressed as (combined into) another single 3D rotation around the origin. A 3D rotation requires a minimum of three values to be fully specified (and even then can require careful definitions of which conventions are used). Also, a simple observation: Rotations around arbitrary points can be treated as rotations around the origin simply by applying a translation before the rotation, and the inverse translation after the rotation. Therefore, for simplicity, this discussion focuses solely on rotations around the origin. Parametrizing 3D Rotations A minimum of three values are required to fully specify a 3D rotation (another result of Euler's), e.g, Euler angles or unit quaternions. However in many cases the best way to specify a rotation is to use four parameters: an axis and an angle. Representation Interpolation Addition Transforming points Vector/Angle - - Good Quaternion Excellent Excellent Good 4x4 Matrix - Excellent Excellent Euler angle - - - Rotation Axis and Angle Per the Euler Rotation Theorem, any two 3D rotations can be combined into a single 3D rotation. A single 3D rotation happens around an axis, and the rotation is a certain angle. This means that it is possible to specify a rotation using four very understanable values: an axis and an angle. Euler Angles One of the more \"human readable\" representation of a 3D rotation is the \"Euler angle\", simplistically, an \"Euler angle\" completely specifies a rotation using only 3 values, which are all \"human readable\" angles around the three coordinate axes, which is very appealing. However, the conventions for  Euler angle values  can vary in a number of ways. Following three.js, the math.gl  Euler  class uses intrinsic Tait-Bryan angles. Note that the large number of representations means that Euler angles exchanged between e.g. different software systems may not be directly compatible (and in addition, converting between the various representations is not exactly easy), so unless care is taken this can cause \"mind-numbing\" confusion. Because of the variability, a good approach is often to be extremely careful when importing and exporting Euler angles from your code, and convert angle Euler angles to Matrix or Quaternion representations (which are much less ambiguous) for further manipulation. Unit Quaternions \"Unit quaternions\" are normally the best representation for \"manipulation\" of 3D rotations. Manpulation here mainly refers to the \"composition\" or \"addition\" and interpolation of rotations. Note that unit quaternions are simply quaternions of norm (or length) equal to  1 , and while a general quaternion (as the name suggests) contains four components, a unit quaternion needs only three values to be fully specified. Unit quaternions can be used to model 3 dimensional rotations. qr v qr-1 Interpolation of quaternions is done using Spherical Linear intERPolation (aka SLERP). Rotation Matrices When combining rotations with other transformations (translations, scalings, projections etc), 4x4 matrices are the representation of choice. Properties of Rotation Matrices A rotation matrix T\nRR = I Note that a matrix R satisfying this can also include an inversion (improper rotation matrix) Converting between Rotation Representations Executing Rotation Transformations While Euler angles are often a good way to specify 3D rotations, they can not directly be used to transfor points or vectors. To do that, they have to be converted to . Rotations using Rotation Matrices A rotation matrix T\nRR = I Combining Rotations The fact that rotations. They can either be combined as w Math with Euler Angles Math with Quaternions Interpolating Rotations To avoid issues with gimbal locks and flips, it is recommended to use quaternions when interpolating rotations. Calculate the quaternion that represents the rotation you want to apply (e.g. moves the start rotation to the target rotation), and then just interpolate q with the identity quaternion using  slerp() . The resulting quaternion can then be used directly to transform  Vector s or it can be transformed into a  Matrix4  transformation matrix. Background: Rotations are Complicated If you are new to working with rotations and the amount of complications outlined in this article seem overwhelming, take some comfort in the fact that rotations in three and higher dimensional spaces are indeed quite complicated to treat mathematically. As an example, several fundamental properties of rotations are highly dependent on the number of dimensions involved. To help the reader who has not worked extensively with rotations build some \"intuition\" for the fact that 3D rotations are non-trivial, the following summary shows how the nice, structured properties of 2D rotations gradually disappear as the number of dimensions increase: In two dimensions, rotations are highly structured and intuitive: A series of 2D rotations can be applied in any order (they commute). Any 2D rotation can be fully parametrized by a single value (the \"angle\").\nThe combination of two 2D rotations can always be expressed as another single rotation (simply by taking the sum of the angles of the two rotations). In three dimensions rotation start to loose some structure:\n  In 3D, rotations are no longer order-independent (they are not commutative), meaning that applying the same two rotations in different order will often yield different results.\n  However, by  Euler's Rotation Theorem , two 3D rotations around the origin can still always be expressed as (combined into) another single 3D rotation around the origin.  *  Also, a 3D rotation requires not two, but a minimum of three values to be fully specified. To give some contrast, in four and higher dimensions: Naturally, rotations still no longer commutative. And worse: Euler's Rotation Theorem no longer holds. There are now two different types of basic rotations, and the combination of two rotations will in general not result in another \"rotation\", but another, more complex transformation. In addition, the number of parameters (degrees of freedom) required to fully specify a rotation grows with mind-boggling rapidity, as 2^(n-1) - 1, meaning that e.g. a \"21 dimensional rotation\" would require over one million values to be fully specified! Background: More on Euler Angles Euler angle values Axis Order  - the order of rotations needs to be defined. There are 6 ways to order rotations around the three axis. Choice of Axes  - \"Classic Euler\" angles follow a Z-Y-Z, convention, rotating around the same angle first and last. However, in modern applications (e.g. Aerospace and Nautical), the \"Tait-Brya\" Intrinsic or Extrinsic  - One one also needs to define whether the angles are intrinsic or extrinsic.\nAs a comparison: three.js  Euler  class uses intrinsic Tait-Bryan angles. \"Intrinsic\" means that rotations are performed with respect to the local coordinate system. That is, for order 'XYZ', the rotation is first around the local-X axis (which is the same as the world-X axis), then around local-Y (which may now be different from the world Y-axis), then local-Z (which may be different from the world Z-axis). Remarks In this article, the word \"axes\" represents the plural of a (coordinate) \"axis\" (normally, the word \"axes\" refers to the X, Y and Z coordinate axes). Note  that one of the most efficient way to specify rotations is to use the Euler-Rodrigues parameters, which has some of the quaternion representation without requiring the introduction of quaternion algebra. math.gl does not directly support this representation though although the vector/angle can easily be converted.","headings":[{"value":"3D Rotations","depth":1},{"value":"Properties of 3D Rotations","depth":3},{"value":"Parametrizing 3D Rotations","depth":2},{"value":"Rotation Axis and Angle","depth":3},{"value":"Euler Angles","depth":3},{"value":"Unit Quaternions","depth":3},{"value":"Rotation Matrices","depth":2},{"value":"Properties of Rotation Matrices","depth":2},{"value":"Converting between Rotation Representations","depth":2},{"value":"Executing Rotation Transformations","depth":2},{"value":"Rotations using Rotation Matrices","depth":2},{"value":"Combining Rotations","depth":2},{"value":"Interpolating Rotations","depth":2},{"value":"Background: Rotations are Complicated","depth":2},{"value":"Background: More on Euler Angles","depth":2},{"value":"Remarks","depth":2}],"slug":"modules/core/docs/concepts/rotations","title":"3D Rotations"},{"excerpt":"View and Projection Matrices One of the major functions of any 3D math library is to let applications create view and projection matrices to enable positioning of the viewer in a 3D world and projection of a field-of-view onto a flat \"screen\". View and Projection Matrices To set up a 4x4 view projection matrix you need a view matrix (specifying the position, direction and orientation of the camera) and a projection matrix (specifying the characteristics of the camera such as its field of view etc). The purpose of the view matrix is to translate and rotate your world coordinates so that the eye is located in the origin  [0, 0, 0] , looking down the positive  Z  axis, rotated so that the right direction is  up . This is called the \"view coordinate system\". The purpose of the projection matrix is to transform from view coordinates to \"clipspace\" coordinates (which is the only coordinate system that the GPU can work directly with). If a point is between  -1  and  1  (after  w  scaling) in clipspace, it will be rendered. The  z  coordinate in clipspace is also scaled (using 'near' and 'far' planes) and if between  -1  and  1  it is used for depth test. Note: while a projection matrix may generate coordinates with  w !== 1 , the GPU will automatically divide the  xyzw  coordinates with the  w  coordinateof any positions it receives thus and \"normalize\" the  w  coordinate. Thus, there is no need to do this scaling manually in shaders unless doing additional arithmetic in clipspace. Creating a View Matrix To create a view matrix Matrix4.lookAt({...}) Normally positions are transformed by the view matrix. If doing work (e.g. lighting) in view space you will also want to transform other geometry such as normals. Projection Matrices Projection matrices typically show everything inside a frustum (truncated pyramid) or a cube in the view space. Their job is to \"scale\" or \"skew\" the geometry inside this virtual shape into the clipspace cube, which is the coordinate system the GPU takes as input. Perspective Projection Matrix To create a projection matrix use: Matrix4.perspective({fov, aspect, near, far}) Creating an Orthographic Projection Matrix math.gl provides the traditional function create an orhtographic projection matrix by providing the \"box\" extents: Matrix4.ortho({right, left, top, bottom, near, far}) The extents are specified in \"view space\" (which is typically translated and rotated, but not scaled, world space). Switching between Perspective and Orthographic Views In applications it is not unusual to want to offer both perspective and orthographic views. To support this case, math.gl offers an additional method for creating orthographic projection matrix, that takes the same parameters as  Matrix4.perspective() , with the addition of one additional parameter,  focalDistance  that selects which plane in the perspective view frustum should be used to calculate the size of the orthographic view box. Matrix4.orthographic({fovy, aspect, focalDistance, near, far}) About Projection Matrices An ortograhic projection matrix essentially just scales your view to show everything within a box. As can be seen in the matrix below, it just centers your view between the bounds of the box, and scales your positions so that the box limits fall on -1 and +1 in each direction. It also does an inversion of the X and Y coordinates.

Determinant calculation is somewhat expensive. transpose Sets this matrix to its transpose matrix. matrix4.transpose() The transpose matrix mirrors the original matrix elements in the diagonal. invert Sets this matrix to its inverse matrix. matrix4.invert() The inverse matrix mirrors the original matrix elements in the diagonal. multiplyLeft Multiplies in another matrix from the left matrix4.multiplyLeft(matrix4) When using  Matrix4  to transform vectors, the vectors are multiplied in from the right. This means that the multiplying in a matrix from the left will cause it to be applied last during transformation (unless additional matrices are multiplied in from the left of course). multiplyRight matrix4.multiplyRight(matrix4) When using  Matrix4  to transform vectors, the vectors are multiplied in from the right. This means that the multiplying in a matrix from the left will cause it to be applied last during transformation (unless additional matrices are multiplied in from the left of course). rotateX Adds a rotation by the given angle around the X axis.

During vector transformation the given translation values are added to each component of the vector being transformed. transformPoint(vector : Number 4 ) : Number 4 Transforms any 2, 3 or 4 element vector as a \"point\" by multiplying it (from the right) with this matrix.  Point  here means that the returned vector will include any translations in this matrix. const vector = matrix4.transformPoint(vector, out=) vector  ( Array | Vector2 | Vector3 | Vector4 ) out  - unless supplied, will be a Vector2, Vector3 or Vector4, matching the length of input vector.\nReturns  out , or a newly minted  Vector2 ,  Vector3  or  Vector4 If  vector  is specified in homogeneous coordinates,  w  coordinate must NOT be  0 .

Using the projective representation allows JavaScript applications to perform the same calculations that the GPU does. A main feature of vectors is that they can be transformed by matrices and quaternions. And  Vector4 s are particular general when transformed with 4x4 matrices ( Matrix4  or just arrays of 16 numbers), as those can include translations, projections and other transformations that cannot be expressed by e.g. 3x3 matrices or quaternions alone. Note that the fourth element  w  is not a coordinate but a scaling factor. The fourth component ( w ) is usually set to either 0  to represent a vector 1  to represent a point Vector4  methods will keep the vector scaled so that  w  (if non-zero) is  1 . The math behind  Vector4  comes from projective geometry, which significantly generalizes calculations and removes a number of special cases compared to affine geometry.

The change was made to make it possible for tree-shaking bundlers to remove unused experimental exports from applications. v1.2 Release date: May 4, 2018 New  lerp  utility Experimental  Pose  class v1.1 Release date: April 16, 2018 Matrix4 Improvements Matrix4.orthographic()  - To simplify switching between perspective and orthographic views, math.gl now offers an additional method for creating orthographic projection matrix, that takes the same parameters as  Matrix4.perspective() , with the addition of one additional parameter,  focalDistance . See  Matrix4.orthographic ({fovy, aspect, focalDistance, near, far}) Bundle Size Reduction math.gl has been tuned to have approximately 20% smaller footprint when bundled in applications. THREE.js Compatibility math.gl classes now pass large parts of the THREE.js test suite, which should make it easier to reuse code written for the THREE.js math library. v1.0 Release date: Jan 9, 2018 Initial release.","headings":[{"value":"What's New","depth":1},{"value":"v3.4 alpha","depth":2},{"value":"v3.3","depth":2},{"value":"v3.2","depth":2},{"value":"v3.1","depth":2},{"value":"@math.gl/web-mercator","depth":3},{"value":"v3.0","depth":2},{"value":"@math.gl/geospatial","depth":3},{"value":"@math.gl/culling","depth":3},{"value":"@math.gl/core","depth":3},{"value":"v2.3","depth":2},{"value":"v2.2","depth":2},{"value":"v2.0","depth":2},{"value":"New Naming Convention for Experimental Exports","depth":3},{"value":"v1.2","depth":2},{"value":"v1.1","depth":2},{"value":"Matrix4 Improvements","depth":3},{"value":"Bundle Size Reduction","depth":3},{"value":"THREE.js Compatibility","depth":3},{"value":"v1.0","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/whats-new","title":"What's New"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["484347790"]}
